# **ðŸŒ± A Journey Back to the Web â€” Just Pure Passion**

It all started in October 2022. I was just a student preparing for NEET, but instead of sticking to the syllabus, I found myself learning Python from NCERT booksâ€”for no reason at all. Just curiosity. Just vibes.

By December 2022, I made my first website with plain HTML and CSS. It was simple, raw, but beautiful to me. A month later, in January 2023, I published my first public website. No audience, no expectationsâ€”just the joy of creating.

At that time, I never imagined Iâ€™d end up in B.Tech. I was aiming for NEET, but I wasnâ€™t even interested in the syllabus. What I truly loved was Computer Scienceâ€”a subject I didnâ€™t even have in school. Still, I downloaded NCERT CS books, read them for fun, and kept learning.

Then came NEET. A disaster. I couldnâ€™t make it to a government MBBS college, and that heartbreak pushed me toward engineering in 2024.

In college, we shifted focus to Flutter app developmentâ€”I made apps, built Firebase backends, and explored Genkit AI and full-stack platforms like music streamers, video apps, and e-commerce systems. But I stopped making websites.

Until recently.

After 1.5 years, I built a pure HTML-CSS site again, just because a friend asked. And guess what? I hadn't forgotten a thing. That sparkâ€”itâ€™s still alive.

This repo marks my return to the web. Itâ€™s not just code.
Itâ€™s me, remembering why I fell in love with tech in the first place.
